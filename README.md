To fork this website and maintain the photo curation, add a config.js file in the root folder with the following:
```
var config = {
    flickr: {
         key: "<Your flickr api key here.>",
         userId: "<Your flickr ID here.>"
    }
 }
```

For just the curated photo feed, check out https://github.com/joaoritter/curator/blob/master/index.js.
